# 定时抓取Github Trending里的数据

作为一个间歇性“松鼠症”患者，有时候会花几个小时逛Github Trending，生怕漏掉什么重要的东西，说到底是心理作用罢了。

而这个Github Trend爬虫，就是我给自己开的一味药，都收集起来，就不怕漏掉啥了（虽然这个逻辑经不起推敲，不过确实部署这个爬虫之后，我再也没有逛过Github Trend）

* 基于[Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)的爬虫
* 使用[click](https://github.com/pallets/click)实现了命令行参数
* 使用[Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/)来设置定时参数
